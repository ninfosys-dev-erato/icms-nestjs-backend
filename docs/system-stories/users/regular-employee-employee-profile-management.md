## üë§ Our Story's Hero: Bikash Thapa

üë®‚Äçüíª **Bikash Thapa** | 28 years old | Government Officer

### Background

    Bikash Thapa is a 28-year-old Government Officer working in the Department 
    of Local Development. He joined the civil service 3 years ago after 
    completing his Bachelor's degree in Public Administration. As a relatively 
    new employee, he is still learning the various government systems and 
    processes while managing his daily administrative responsibilities.
    
    Bikash primarily uses the government CMS to access information, view 
    announcements, download necessary documents, and manage his personal 
    profile. He occasionally needs to update his contact information, change 
    his password, and access reports relevant to his department's work.
    
    While not highly technical, Bikash is comfortable with basic computer 
    operations and web interfaces. He values simple, intuitive systems that 
    don't require extensive technical knowledge. He often relies on help 
    documentation and colleague assistance when encountering system issues.
  

### What Bikash Thapa wants to achieve:
- Access personal profile and keep information up-to-date
- Easily navigate the system to find needed information and documents
- Manage password and security settings independently
- View department announcements and important updates
- Download and access work-related documents and forms
- Understand system features through clear documentation
- Complete profile updates efficiently without IT support
- Access training materials and system help resources

### Bikash Thapa's challenges:
- Complex system interfaces that are difficult to navigate
- Uncertainty about which information can be updated independently
- Password requirements that are hard to remember and follow
- Lack of clear instructions for common profile management tasks
- Fear of making mistakes that could affect system access
- Difficulty finding help when encountering system issues
- Long loading times and system performance issues
- Inconsistent user experience across different system sections

    "timestamp": "2025-07-27T11:09:43.354Z",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

**What happened**: Viewing the current profile helps Bikash understand what information is stored about him and identifies what needs to be updated for accuracy.

---

### Step 3: Bikash updates his phone number and profile picture after moving to a new address and wanting to have a current professional photo. ‚úÖ

  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-27T11:09:43.369Z",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

**What happened**: Verification gives Bikash confidence that his updates were successful and helps him understand the effectiveness of the self-service system.

---

### Step 5: Bikash explores his profile interface to understand what information he can manage himself and what requires administrator assistance. ‚úÖ

**What Bikash Thapa expects**: The interface should clearly indicate which fields are editable and provide helpful guidance about profile management options.

**API Call**: `EXPLORE profile-capabilities-analysis`

          }
        },
        "header": {
          "x-powered-by": "Express",
          "x-request-id": "req_1753614583379_pwptjw9qk",
          "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",

        "status": 403,
        "text": "{\"success\":false,\"error\":{\"code\":\"FORBIDDEN_ERROR\",\"message\":\"Insufficient permissions\"},\"meta\":{\"timestamp\":\"2025-07-27T11:09:43.381Z\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\"}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "roleValidation": "VIEWER role restrictions working correctly"
}
```

**What happened**: Role-based access control testing helps verify security boundaries and ensures employees understand their access scope, preventing confusion and maintaining system integrity.

---

### Step 7: Bikash reflects on his profile management experience, noting that the system provides appropriate self-service capabilities for basic employee needs. ‚úÖ
