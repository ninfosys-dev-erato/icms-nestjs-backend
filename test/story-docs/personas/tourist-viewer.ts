  background: `
    John Smith is a 28-year-old software developer from the United States who 
    is planning a trekking trip to Nepal. He's tech-savvy but completely new 
    to Nepali government systems. He represents the typical international 
    visitor who needs to access government information and services.
    
    John is used to modern, intuitive interfaces and has high expectations 
    for user experience. He's comfortable with technology but expects systems 
    to be self-explanatory. He values quick access to information and doesn't 
    want to spend time figuring out complex navigation.
    
    As a tourist, John needs specific information about permits, local regulations, 
    contact information, and downloadable forms. He might access the system 
    from different devices and potentially slower internet connections.
