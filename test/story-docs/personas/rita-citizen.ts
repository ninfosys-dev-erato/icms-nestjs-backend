  background: `
    Rita Tamang is a 42-year-old local business owner who runs a small restaurant 
    in Kathmandu. She frequently visits the government website to stay informed 
    about local events, policy announcements, and community programs that might 
    affect her business and daily life.
    
    She's particularly interested in viewing photos and videos from government 
    events, community programs, and official announcements. Rita often looks for 
    visual content to understand what's happening in her community and to stay 
    connected with government activities.
    
    She has basic technical skills and prefers simple, intuitive interfaces. 
    Rita accesses the website primarily from her mobile phone and expects content 
    to load quickly and be easy to navigate. She values visual content that helps 
    her understand government communications better.
