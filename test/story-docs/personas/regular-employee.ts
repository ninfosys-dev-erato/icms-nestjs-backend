  background: `
    Bikash Thapa is a 28-year-old Government Officer working in the Department 
    of Local Development. He joined the civil service 3 years ago after 
    completing his Bachelor's degree in Public Administration. As a relatively 
    new employee, he is still learning the various government systems and 
    processes while managing his daily administrative responsibilities.
    
    Bikash primarily uses the government CMS to access information, view 
    announcements, download necessary documents, and manage his personal 
    profile. He occasionally needs to update his contact information, change 
    his password, and access reports relevant to his department's work.
    
    While not highly technical, Bikash is comfortable with basic computer 
    operations and web interfaces. He values simple, intuitive systems that 
    don't require extensive technical knowledge. He often relies on help 
    documentation and colleague assistance when encountering system issues.
